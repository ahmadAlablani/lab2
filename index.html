      <p class="pragraphs"> The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal and a baleen whale. 
            Reaching a maximum confirmed length of 29.9 m (98 ft) and weighing up to 199 (196 long tons; 219 short tons), 
            it is the largest animal known ever to have existed.
            The blue whale was abundant in nearly all the Earth's oceans until the end of the 19th century. 
            It was hunted almost to the point of extinction by whalers until the 
            International Whaling Commission banned all blue whale hunting in 1966.</p>
